# Integration

**Single source:** [INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md)

That file is the only integration guide. It includes:

- Base URLs (dev, staging, prod)
- Auth flow (credentials, login-url, login, status, token update)
- Health and service info
- Market data (status, quotes, data, historical, instruments)
- Analysis (context, intelligence, stock, enhanced context)
- Trading (status, quick opportunities)
- Request-body reference table

For request/response shapes, use [api/api-reference.md](../api/api-reference.md) and [html/request-response-models.html](../html/request-response-models.html).
